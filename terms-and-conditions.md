**Last Updated: October 21, 2025**

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Personal Board application, which includes our Progressive Web App (PWA) and our Chrome Extension (collectively, the "Service") operated by the owner of Personal Board ("us", "we", or "our").

Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the Service.

By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the Service.

## 1. Description of Service

Personal Board is a digital tool designed to help users capture, organize, and manage content, including notes, images, links, and other materials ("Content") on a personal board. The Service is available as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and a Chrome Extension.

## 2. User Accounts

You can use the Service on a local, device-only basis without creating an account.

Optionally, you may create an account using Google Authentication to enable features such as cloud synchronization via your personal Google Drive. If you choose to create an account, you are responsible for safeguarding the account and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree to notify us immediately upon becoming aware of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account.

## 3. User-Generated Content

### a. Ownership

You retain full ownership of all the Content you create, save, or store using the Service. We do not claim any ownership rights over your Content. All Content is stored locally on your device's browser storage (IndexedDB) and, if you enable the sync feature, a copy is stored in a private folder within your own Google Drive account. We do not have access to your Content unless you explicitly share it.

### b. Your Responsibility

You are solely responsible for the Content you post, link, or otherwise make available via the Service. You represent and warrant that your Content does not violate the law or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including copyright, trademark, privacy, or other personal or proprietary rights.

### c. Limited License to Us

To operate and provide the Service, you grant us a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, store, display, reproduce, modify (for technical purposes, e.g., formatting for display), and distribute your Content solely on and through the Service, and only for the purpose of providing the Service to you. This license ends when you delete your Content or your account.

## 4. Acceptable Use

You agree not to use the Service for any purpose that is illegal or prohibited by these Terms. You agree not to:

*   Upload or share any Content that is unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, or otherwise objectionable.
*   Infringe upon any patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright, or other proprietary rights of any party.
*   Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Service.
*   Use any automated system, including "robots" or "spiders," to access the Service in a manner that sends more request messages to our servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period.
*   Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Service or the data contained therein.

## 5. Intellectual Property

The Service and its original content (excluding Content provided by users), features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the owner of Personal Board. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both India and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent.

## 6. Third-Party Services

The Service may offer integration with third-party services, such as Google Drive for synchronization. Your use of any third-party service is subject to that service's own terms and conditions and privacy policies. We are not responsible or liable for the content, policies, or practices of any third-party web sites or services.

## 7. Termination

We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach the Terms.

Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service and delete your data from your local browser storage and your connected Google Drive folder.

All provisions of the Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.

## 8. Disclaimer of Warranties

The Service is provided on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis. Your use of the Service is at your sole risk. The Service is provided without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or course of performance.

b) any errors or defects will be corrected;
c) the Service is free of viruses or other harmful components; or
d) the results of using the Service will meet your requirements.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

In no event shall the owner of Personal Board, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:
(i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service;
(ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service;
(iii) any content obtained from the Service; and
(iv) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.

## 10. Governing Law

These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Delhi, India, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect.

## 11. Changes to Terms

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will try to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.

By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.
