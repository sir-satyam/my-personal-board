# Privacy Policy for Personal Board

**Last Updated: October 21, 2025**

Welcome to Personal Board ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our Personal Board application, which includes our Progressive Web App (PWA) and our Chrome Extension (collectively, the "Service").

Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the service.

## 1. Information We Collect

Our guiding principle is to collect only the minimum information necessary to provide and improve the Service. Your content—your notes, images, and links—is yours. We do not have access to the content you save unless you explicitly share it.

### A. Data You Provide and Store

All content you create and save within the Personal Board application is stored locally on your device using your browser's internal database (IndexedDB). This includes:

*   **Cards and Folders:** Any notes, checklists, images, links, videos, and other content you save to your boards, as well as the folders you create to organize them.
*   **Application Settings:** Preferences you set for the application, such as appearance settings (e.g., background image, theme).

### B. Information You Provide for Google Sync (Optional)

If you choose to log in with your Google account to enable cloud synchronization, we interact with Google APIs to access specific information required for authentication and data backup.

*   **Google Account Information:** We receive your name, email address, and profile picture from Google to identify you within the application. This allows you to have a personalized experience and manage your account.
*   **Google Drive Data (Scoped Access):** When you enable sync, you grant the Service permission to access its own dedicated folder within your Google Drive. The Service creates a folder named **`myBoardApp`**. **Our access is strictly limited to this folder.** We use this to store backups of your cards and other application data. We do not have permission to access, view, or modify any other files or folders in your Google Drive.

### C. Information Collected by the Chrome Extension

When you use the Personal Board Chrome Extension to capture content from the web, the following information is temporarily collected and stored locally in your browser before being added to your board:

*   **Selected Text:** Text you highlight and choose to save as a note.
*   **Image and Page URLs:** The web address of images or pages you save.
*   **Screenshots:** A snapshot of the visible tab, if you choose to capture it as an image.

This data is stored temporarily in your browser's local storage and is moved to the main application database (IndexedDB) when you open your board.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Service. Specifically, we use your data to:

*   **Provide Core Functionality:** To save, display, and organize your cards and folders on your local device.
*   **Authenticate Your Account:** To securely log you in via your Google account.
*   **Enable Cloud Sync:** To back up and sync your data to your own Google Drive account, allowing you to access your board across multiple devices.
*   **Enable Collaboration:** To allow you to share a board with other users via Google Drive, should you choose to do so.
*   **Provide Notifications:** To send you reminders for cards with due dates, with your permission.

**We do not sell your personal information. We do not use your personal information or your content for advertising purposes.**

## 3. How Your Information Is Stored and Secured

*   **Local-First Storage:** Your primary data is always stored on your own device in your browser's secure storage. You have full control over this data. If you clear your browser's site data for our application, all your local data will be permanently deleted.
*   **Google Drive Backup:** If you enable sync, a copy of your data is stored in a dedicated folder within your personal Google Drive. The security of this data is handled by Google's robust security infrastructure. You can revoke our access to your Google Drive at any time from your Google Account settings. Doing so will stop synchronization, but will not delete the data already in your Drive folder.
*   **Data Transmission:** All communication with Google's services is encrypted using industry-standard Transport Layer Security (TLS).

## 4. Sharing Your Information

You are in control of who sees your data. We do not share your information, except in the specific scenarios you initiate:

*   **When You Share a Board:** If you use the collaboration feature, you are using Google Drive's native sharing functionality to grant access to other Google users you specify. The permissions (viewer, editor) are managed through Google Drive.
*   **When You Share a Card:** If you create a public link to a specific card, anyone with that link will be able to view a read-only version of that card's content.

We will not share your data with any other third parties for any reason, unless required to do so by law.

## 5. Your Data Rights and Choices

*   **Access and Edit:** You can access, edit, and delete your cards and folders directly within the Personal Board application at any time.
*   **Revoke Access:** You can revoke the Service's access to your Google Account at any time by visiting your Google Account security settings page. This will disconnect your account and stop all synchronization.
*   **Data Deletion:** You can delete all your data stored locally by clearing your browser's cache and site data for our application URL. If you have sync enabled, you can also manually delete the `myBoardApp` folder from your Google Drive to remove your cloud backup.

## 6. Policy for Children

We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date of this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed of our privacy practices.
